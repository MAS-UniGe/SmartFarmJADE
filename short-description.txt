The MAS is described by a report in the docs folder of the project. It simulates an agricultural environment where autonomous agents handle the crops. 
The agents are drones, robots and self-driving tractors, and each of them covers a different role in maintaining the crops well being and maximizing the land yield. The amount of agent instances and the map size are configurable.
